Problem Statement:-

U.S. airlines are experiencing significant delays, with over 88,000 flights cancelled out of 527,000 analyzed. The delays are primarily caused by carrier-related issues and weather disruptions, disproportionately affecting major airlines like Southwest and American Airlines. Additionally, delays are more frequent during evenings and on Fridays and Sundays, indicating systemic inefficiencies in scheduling and resource allocation.

Recommendations:-

1. Optimize Scheduling Algorithms

Use machine learning to predict peak delay windows and adjust flight schedules accordingly.
Prioritize early-day departures to reduce cascading delays.

2. Improve Carrier Operations

Invest in predictive maintenance and crew management systems to reduce carrier-related delays.
Upgrade aging aircraft fleets (average age: 14 years) to improve reliability.

3. Weather-Responsive Planning

Integrate real-time weather analytics into routing and scheduling.
Develop contingency protocols for high-risk weather zones and seasons.

4. Passenger-Centric Communication

Enhance delay notifications and rebooking systems to reduce passenger frustration.
Offer incentives or flexible options during high-delay periods (e.g., weekends).
