Problem Statement:-
Despite achieving strong overall sales and high average order value, Madhav Ecommerce faces regional imbalance, product concentration, and seasonal profit volatility. 

Key challenges include:-

Underperformance in states like Delhi and Gujarat.
Heavy reliance on clothing as the primary product category.
Cash on Delivery (COD) dominating payment methods, which may increase operational risk.
Profit dips in months like April and June, indicating poor seasonal planning.

Proposed Solution :- 
1. Regional Sales Optimization

Launch localized marketing campaigns in Delhi and Gujarat.
Offer region-specific discounts or bundles to attract new customers.
Partner with local influencers or delivery services to improve reach and trust.

2. Product Diversification

Expand profitable sub-categories like printers, bookcases, and storage.
Introduce seasonal collections or limited-time categories to test demand.
Use customer purchase history to recommend cross-category products.

3. Payment Strategy Enhancement

Incentivize UPI and digital payments with cashback or loyalty points.
Gradually reduce COD dependency to streamline logistics and reduce returns.

4. Seasonal Profit Planning

Run targeted promotions in April and June to boost engagement.
Align inventory and ad spend with peak months like January and March.



Summary

Strong revenue and AOV driven by clothing and key customers.
Maharashtra leads in sales; Delhi and Gujarat underperform.
COD dominates payments; UPI is rising.
January and March are peak profit months.
Printers and bookcases are top profit generators.
